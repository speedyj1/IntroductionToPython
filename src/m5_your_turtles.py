# TODO: 2.
#
#  You should have RUN the PREVIOUS module and READ its code.
#  (Do so now if you have not already done so.)
#
#  Below this comment, add ANY CODE THAT YOUR WANT, as long as:
#    1. You construct at least 2 rg.SimpleTurtle objects.
#    2. Each rg.SimpleTurtle object draws something
#         (by moving, using its rg.Pen).  ANYTHING is fine!
#    3. Each rg.SimpleTurtle moves inside a LOOP.
#
#  Be creative!  Strive for way-cool pictures!  Abstract pictures rule!
#
#  If you make syntax (notational) errors, no worries -- get help
#  fixing them at either this session OR at the NEXT session.
#
#  Don't forget to COMMIT your work by using  VCS ~ Commit and Push.
